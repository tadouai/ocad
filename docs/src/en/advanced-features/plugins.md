# Plugins

## What are they?

`Plugins` in Figma are tools developed by the community that enhance your productivity by providing access to resources or new features within Figma.

The plugins tab is located in the menu represented by the icon <img src="../../assets/img/figma/advanced-features/plugins/plugin-icon.png"> on the toolbar. From this interface, you'll find your recently used plugins and a search function for plugins.

## Widgets

`Widgets` are interactive objects similar to plugins. Unlike plugins, which work for a specific individual, everyone can see and interact with the same widget directly from the workspace.

You can add as many widgets to the file as necessary and even run them simultaneously.

Widgets are accessible from the same location as plugins: <img src="../../assets/img/figma/advanced-features/plugins/plugin-icon.png">
