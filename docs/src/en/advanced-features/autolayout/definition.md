## Autolayout

Autolayout is a property that can be added to a `Frame`. It allows you to create designs that adapt in width/height by shrinking/expanding. This is ideal when you need to add elements (automatic positioning), accommodate longer texts, or maintain alignments as your design evolves.

There are several ways to use autolayout:
- Create buttons that stretch according to the size of the text they contain
- Create lists that adjust when an item is added, removed, or hidden
- Combine `Frame` with autolayout to create complete and responsive interfaces

Autolayout is a powerful feature, and we will discuss its properties.
