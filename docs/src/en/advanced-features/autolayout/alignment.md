# Alignments

## Aligning elements in an autolayout frame

In a `Frame` with `Autolayout`, the alignment of elements is grouped! You cannot control the alignment of each individual element (unlike in classic `Frames`).

That's why the alignment is adjusted from the autolayout and not on each element!

Use the alignment box in the `Design panel` on the right under the `Autolayout` property to change the alignment of the elements inside your `Frame`.

> **Note:** The `Direction` and `Gap` of your autolayout determine which alignment options are possible inside it.

**Exercise:** Test the alignment
- Expand the `Frame` that contains your circles
- Try to change the alignment in the alignment box of your `Autolayout`
- Change the direction (Horizontal, Vertical, Wrap) and then test the different alignments again
- Do the same by changing the `Gap` <img class="figma-button align-text" height="24px" alt="spacing button" src="../../../assets/img/figma/common/spacing-button.svg"> (either "Auto" or a pixel value!)
