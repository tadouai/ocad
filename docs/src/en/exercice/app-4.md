:::

A good approach would be to create a component for one element of the menu, with a selected and a deselected variant.

::: tip Tip
To create the horizontal bar for the selected state, you can use a `bottom stroke`.
:::

You can then use three instances of this component to create the complete menu.

The autolayout frame will have the white and rounded edges on both sides.

::: tip Tip
Remember to enable `Nested Instances` on the component to easily modify the three menu items!
:::

You now have all the elements needed to create the main part of the screen!
