# Header

::: tip ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Create the page header

The search bar can be created by nesting horizontal autolayouts.

I've chosen to give the departure and arrival destination boxes a dynamic width and to give the other boxes a fixed width.

Once you've created your header, you can assemble your screen!

Place it in a vertical autolayout to be able to test its responsive behavior: the page content and the search bar should have a fixed width, while the top of the header takes the full width of the screen (we will not test the case of a mobile device here).
