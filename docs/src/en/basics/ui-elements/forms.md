Once created and selected, you can modify its properties (e.g., change its color).

You have other tools available to create shapes (lines, arrows, ellipses, etc.).

> **Note:** You can create a custom shape with the `Pen` tool <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="pen tool icon" src="../../../assets/img/figma/common/plume-icon.png">. Simply create a closed path and modify its properties (colors, borders, etc.).

## Shortcuts

### Proportional Resizing ðŸ’¡
To create a perfect circle using Figma's Ellipse tool, hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while drawing.

The same applies to making a square with the Rectangle tool.

More generally, consistently hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when you want to resize your elements proportionally.
