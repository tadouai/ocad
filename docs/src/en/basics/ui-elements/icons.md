# Icons

To add icons to our design, we could do like with images: search on the internet and import or copy-paste into our canvas (a relatively tedious task).

We can simplify and speed up the process by using an `Icon Plugin`!

> **Note:** Figma has a large number of plugins (developed by the community) that can help us with our design. [Click here](../plugin.md) for more information.

Weâ€™ll use the `Iconify` plugin to search for and import our icons. Iconify aggregates the most well-known icon libraries/collections available online (Google Material Symbols, Bootstrap icons, Feather...).

To use this plugin, right-click > `Plugins` > `Manage plugins...`

![right click plugins](../../../assets/img/figma/basics/ui-elements/icons/right-click-plugins.png)

A window will open. Enter `Iconify` in the search bar, and then click on the first result.

![plugins search](../../../assets/img/figma/basics/ui-elements/icons/plugins-search.png)

> **Note:** You can also access plugins directly from the `Assets` tool <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="resources icon" src="../../../assets/img/figma/basics/ui-elements/icons/ressources-icon.png"> in the `Toolbar`.

The `Iconify` window appears, you can then:
- Choose an icon library (e.g., Google Material Icons) to have icons with the same graphic style (design consistency)
- Search for an icon (e.g., phone)
- Select the desired icon and click on `Import icon`

The icon will appear on the canvas, you can then close `Iconify` and place the icon into the `Card`

![use iconify](../../../assets/img/figma/basics/ui-elements/icons/use-iconify.gif)
:::

::: warning Caution
Make sure to select the iconâ€™s frame (outline) and not the vector directly when you move it. The frame is there to properly space the icon from its surroundings.
:::

> **Note:** Unlike an image (PNG, JPG...), the icon is vectorial (`Vector`, see in the `Layers Panel` on the left), so you can change its color and scale it infinitely (without seeing pixels)!

::: tip Reuse a plugin ðŸ’¡
Save Iconify by right-clicking > `Plugins` > `Manage plugins...` and then click the `Save` button in the search results.

![iconify plugin save](../../../assets/img/figma/basics/ui-elements/icons/save-iconify-plugin.png)

From now on, right-click > `Plugins` > `Saved plugins` > `Iconify`.
:::

> **Note:** You can also manually create an icon in Figma directly with the Pen tool (`Pen`) <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="pen tool icon" src="../../../assets/img/figma//common/plume-icon.png">. Simply create a frame and then draw a shape inside it.
