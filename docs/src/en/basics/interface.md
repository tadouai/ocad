# Global Interface

## Create a New File

To create a new file, launch Figma and open a new tab by clicking on the button <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="new tab" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/new_tab.png"> at the top of the screen. Then click on `New design file` (as shown in the following image).

![new design file](../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/1.new_design_file.png)

A new window appears, representing a new Figma file (currently empty).

![empty file](../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/2.empty_file.png)

Your file is now saved to your personal Figma space. It is accessible by clicking on the home button <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="empty file" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/home_button.png"> in the top left of the screen in the `Drafts` menu.

## Global Interface

The Figma interface is divided into 4 sections (A, B, C, and D) that we will describe.

### <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="a" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/A.png"> The Toolbar
<br/>

![toolbar](../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/4.toolbar.png)

Divided into three parts:
- on the left are the creation tools

- in the middle, the Figma file options

- on the right, the sharing tools

### <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="b" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/B.png"> The Canvas

This is where we create and view interface elements using tools available in the `Toolbar`. This space is empty because nothing has been created yet.

### <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="c" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/C.png"> The Design Panel

Here you will find the properties of the element selected on the `Canvas`. Currently, nothing is selected, and by default, you see the properties of the canvas itself (e.g., the background color of the page).

![design panel](../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/design_panel.png)

**To do:** You can change the background color of the page by clicking on the colored square.

### <img class="align-text" height="32px" alt="d" src="../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/D.png"> The Layers Panel

This panel shows the hierarchy of the design (interface elements on the canvas). As soon as an interface element is created on the `Canvas`, it is listed here according to its position.

![layers panel](../../assets/img/figma/basics/interface/layers_panel.png)

> **Note:** Each design element is called a `Layer`. There is a variety of layer types (text, rectangle, group, frame, image, section, vector, etc.). It is with these different elements that we will build interface elements.

This is what the `Layers Panel` might look like for a button created on the `Canvas`:

You can rename layers for better organization:
