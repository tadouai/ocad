# But is Figma free?

It's hard to understand what you can and can't do before each of Figma's shots. Managing rights from within the software is not very intuitive.

That's why we're going to start by demystifying it.

## Drafts

When you create a new Figma `file`, it is created by default in your drafts.

<p align="center"><img src="../../assets/img/figma/introduction/pricings/drafts.png"></p>

In free mode, you can have **as many `files` as you like** in your drafts.

There is no limit to the number of collaborators you can invite to your drafts.

- You cannot give editing rights to other collaborators.

## Teams

By default, Figma has created a `team` with a `project`.

**A `project` is a set of Figma `files`.**

In these `files` you can add **as many collaborators as you like with read or write rights**.

::: danger Team limits in free mode

- 1 `team` maximum.
- 1 `project` maximum in this team.
- 3 `files` maximum in this `project`.
- 3 pages maximum in these `files`.
