# Drawing things? But we don't have time!

(Oh yes, the first person to say "draw" instead of "model" is officially excluded from the course, you've been warned ðŸ¤­)

## Why model?

Vast question. I'll try to extract the main points here.

- **Clarify the overall vision of the application:** It's difficult to have an overall vision of what an application will be without visuals. Documentation and schematics are likely to be inadequate, and many unpleasant surprises are likely to occur during development.

- **Simpler, less costly iterations:** It's much simpler and quicker to iterate on ideas with design software than with code, even when compared to a highly experienced developer. Using such software therefore makes iterations less costly, encouraging you to explore more possibilities.

- **More creative iterations:** with code than with design software. When developing without design, a developer will naturally go for the simplest way of doing things offered by the framework he's using. The result is therefore more likely to be banal.

- **Communication and collaboration:** developing an application involves many people with different skills. Collaborative design software brings all these profiles together around a common medium, facilitating communication and collaboration.

- **Realistic prototypes:** design software can be used to create animated prototypes of models, sometimes very realistic. This can be an opportunity to carry out user tests, but is also a great tool for collaborating with the various project stakeholders, once again around a common medium.

- **Documentation for development:** A developer who works with mock-ups will be more efficient when developing screens. But above all, giving him mock-ups gives him the right tools to help him develop a coherent design with attention to detail. Development without mock-ups will almost always be messy and full of inconsistencies.

## Why Figma?

In recent years, Figma has established itself as the market leader thanks to its intuitive interface, collaborative tools and attractive price.

Compared to other tools, Figma really emphasizes collaboration: it's not a designer's tool, it's the tool that all project stakeholders use.

To give an idea of its popularity, Adobe wanted to buy Figma for $20 billion. For comparison, Twitter was bought for 44 billion and is now worth 19 billion (ðŸ¤¡).
However, this acquisition has been challenged by the European Union on the grounds of Adobe's monopoly.
In any case, Figma's management is unlikely to change, and neither is its business model, at least not for the foreseeable future.
